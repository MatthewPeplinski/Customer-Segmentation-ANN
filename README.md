# Customer-Segmentation-ANN
My first practice creating and using a simple artificial neural network. The linear neural network was used to classify automobile company customers into predefined customer segments.

After training, using the neural network on new data resulted in (in most cases) a perfect classification result indicating the criteria for segmenting customers was fairly easily modeled by the network. Below is the confusion matrix of the segmentation results.
